"Bringing clarity to visually impaired people"
The 'Image to Speech' project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by providing comprehensive audio descriptions of images. Users can capture them via webcam, and the applications generate detailed audio descriptions, including colors, designs, and other relevant information. This project's scope revolves around enhancing accessibility and fostering a better understanding of the visual world for visually impaired individuals.
